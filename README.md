Everything as Code Presentation for DevOpsDays Raleigh

## Concept

Just like in the writing of this README, I made it my mantra to use EVERYTHING as CODE to help me better learn, understand and drive DevOps as a leader in my organization. Now I want to tell you in 5 minutes how that happened.

## Structure

I want to keep this one simple. The last Ignite talk I did, I had too much information to pack in 5 minutes and to time sections with slides was... well, painful. I was brutally unprepared.

I still want to keep this light on memorized dialog. So lets break down the 5 minutes and put together some chapters to put this in. Slides are going to be a lot of code screen shots of the work I did throughout and examples of output. Maybe some Flowdock (since that is what started me on Markdown), Docusaurus for Docs (wiki) and Training, Remarkjs. Show tracking tasks in github issues / projects and also importance of VSCode.

## Slides
