## Bio

> DevOps Enthusiast since 2016, space nerd and currently Sr. Sales Engineer at Progress for Chef Software. Mike has seen all sides of the Coded Enterprise, being the product owner for Chef at a very large healthcare organization.  It is always a challenge to help application and OS support teams to understand "shifting left" or better local development, local testing, using a source code repository for code and helping to identify and track work. Treating Everything as Code helps drive DevOps for n00bs, it certainly helped him!

## Presentation Info

- Ignite
- Title: Everything as Code - A DevOps Primer
- Presentation Abstract:

> This is an Ignite talk discussing treating Everything As Code.  In 2019 I finally forced myself to use GitHub more as it was critical for my customers to also embrace DevOps and develop Chef Code (Infrastructure and Compliance as Code.) I wanted to be able to help them better understand some basic fundamentals of Development since many were coming from a purely Server / Application Operations culture and environment. I myself came from that Server Administrator culture and understood how difficult it can be for some folks to use GitHub (or any repository.) I made the decision one day to just treat _EVERYTHING_ as code. I started with our documentation in moving our customer facing and team documentation and created everything in markdown with Docusaurus to generate our webpage. For personal and day to day work I moved to using GitHub Issues in markdown and tracking work with Projects. I moved my daily notes from OneNote to a repo specific for my notes and everything in markdown.

## Previous Speaking Engagement Experience

>My last Ignite talk was for Columbus DevOpsDays in 2017 [DevOps for Tweens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-PzeiQEaE&t=1s) and I spoke in 2016 at VMWorld. It has been awhile, but my new position at Chef allows me the time to do more engagements (and a lot less bureaucracy than when I was at UnitedHealthGroup).
